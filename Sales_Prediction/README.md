### Dataset
The advertising Dataset Contains below columns
1. TV #  amount of advertising spending on television.
2. Radio #  amount of advertising spending on Radio.
3. News Paper #  amount of advertising spending on NewsPaper.
4. Sales   # sales figures corresponding to the advertising spending in the TV, Radio, and Newspaper channels.  

### KeyComponents 
+ The Dataset included information on advertising expenditures on TV, Radio, and Newspaper.
+ Conducted a thorough exploratory analysis to understand the distribution and relationships 
 between variables.
+ Identified patterns, trends, and potential outliers in the data.
+ Examined the impact of each advertising channel on sales individually.
+ Utilized machine learning techniques, such as linear regression, to build a predictive model.
+ Trained the model on historical data, considering the three advertising channels as features and 
  sales as the target variable.
+ R2- SCORE: 0.899438024100912

### Insights and Recommendations:
+ The correlation coefficient of 0.782 between TV advertising spending and sales indicates a strong positive relationship. This suggests that as the expenditure on TV ads increases, the sales also tend to rise significantly.
+ Recommendations: Allocate a substantial portion of the advertising budget to TV advertising, as it appears to be a highly effective channel for driving sales.
